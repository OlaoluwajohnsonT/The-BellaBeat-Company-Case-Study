In this case study, I find myself on the marketing analytics team at Bellabeat, a company specializing in health-focused products for women. Our mission is to unlock growth opportunities for the company by analyzing smart device fitness data. Under the guidance of Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, I'm tasked with delving into smart device usage trends.

The goal is to gain insights into how consumers utilize non-Bellabeat smart devices, with the aim of applying these findings to enhance our marketing strategy. I'm excited to contribute to Bellabeat's mission of empowering women through data-driven health and wellness solutions.

To begin, I'll explore the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, a publicly available dataset containing minute-level data on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring from Fitbit users. However, I'll also consider supplementing this data to address potential limitations. My journey will involve data preparation, ensuring the dataset's integrity, and addressing any data-related challenges.

Ultimately, I aim to produce a comprehensive report with compelling visualizations and actionable recommendations. By leveraging these insights, we can shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy to resonate with our target audience and drive growth in the competitive smart device market.
